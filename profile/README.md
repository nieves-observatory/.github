## Description

This project is part of the upcoming "GROWTH (Global Relay of Watching Transients Happen) for undergraduates" programme. The project aims to equip astronomy undergraduates around the world with hands-on research skills using remotely-operated telescopes around world. The project right now has formal and informal access to the following observatories housing research-grade optical telescopes:

### Nieves Observatory

The Nieves Observatory is based in California and was built in 2019 housing a 0.3m CDK optical telescope. The telescope is equipped with a research-grade FLI camera and a filter wheel with both broad-band (Sloan) and narrow-band filters. The observatory is owned by the Soka University of America, funded by the Nieves Family Foundation.

### Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO)

The LCRO sits on top the mountains of Chile's Atacama Desert, housing an almost-identical 0.3m CDK optical telescope. The LCRO is a joint project of the LCO, Astro Physics Corporation, Finger Lakes Instruments, Mike Long, Dave Jurasevich, and SSC Observatories.

The app is part of a larger pipeline that includes:

1. Getting access to telescopes
1. Learning to operate the telescopes
1. Reducing and manipulating the images from the observatories
1. Obtaining and analysing research results from the images

Observarium comes in in Step 2 to help educators and students select valuable targets, which reduces time wastage on the telescopes.
